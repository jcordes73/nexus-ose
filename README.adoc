= Developing Java applications using a Nexus Container for maven dependencies in OpenShift Enterprise 3

This sample project demonstrates how you can use Nexus in an OpenShift environment. How you can create applications that will fetch the dependencies from your internal nexus container.

NOTE: This is a Proof of Concept. NOT SUPPORTED!!!


The steps that will be done are the following:

* Deploy a nexus container configured for accessing Red Hat's maven repository
* Install all base images we will be using
** Centos: centos:cetos7


== Deploy a nexus container configured for accessing Red Hat's maven repository
Our nexus instance will live in a project called (*ci*), so to start, we need to create this project and add all the required resources:

----
oc new-project ci --display-name="Continuous Integration for OpenShift" --description="This project holds all continuous integration required infrastructure, like Nexus, Jenkins,..."

oc create -f nexus/ose3/nexus-resources.json -n ci
----

Once we have created all the nexus resources, we can go ahead and create a nexus instance. There is 2 templates for creating a Nexus instance (ephemeral and persitent) in the *ci* project. 
To create your project just go do in the ci project:

* Add to project

* Select Image or Template (filter with *nexus*) and select one of the templates (nexus-persistent or nexus-ephemeral)

image:images/template.png[Select template]

* Provide with the required parameters.

* Wait for deployment

* Access the console, in the provided HOSTNAME. (http://nexus.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io in my example)

NOTE: By default, nexus credentials will be *admin/admin123*

On the CLI you also use the following command:

----
oc new-app --template=nexus-ephemeral --param=APPLICATION_HOSTNAME=openshift.example.com
----

The parameter APPLICATION_HOSTNAME configures the route in such a way that Nexus is available at a specific hostname.

=== Details to know
It is very important to know that the service is available through DNS internally to all other applications running in OpenShift, and externally at the provided hostname: 

* *External DNS*: nexus.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io
* *Internal DNS*: nexus.ci.svc.cluster.local

Also, important to understand that if OpenShift is configured with the SDN multitenant plugin, you need to allow access to this project (*ci*) from any other project that wants to use it, or by making the ci project global, with:

----
oadm pod-network make-projects-global ci 
----

=== Defining your Persistent Volume for using nexus-persistent template
If you want to create a nexus persistent instance, you need to provide with a persistent volume named: *nexus-pv* with *ReadWriteOnce* mode and the ammount of space that you wish. You can use hostPath, nfs, or any other storage. 
See examples link:nexus/ose3/resources/pv/[here].

As an example (in an all-in-one VM), you can do as root (cluster:admin) the following:

----
mkdir /tmp/nexus

chmod 777 /tmp/nexus

oc create -f - <<-EOF
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "PersistentVolume",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "nexus-pv",
        "labels": {
           "type": "local"
        }
    },
    "spec": {
        "hostPath": {
            "path": "/tmp/nexus"
        },
        "accessModes": [
            "ReadWriteOnce"
        ],
        "capacity": {
            "storage": "5Gi"
        },
        "persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy": "Retain"
    }
}
EOF

oc get scc hostaccess -o json \
        | sed '/\"users\"/a \"system:serviceaccount:ci:nexus\",'  \
        | oc replace scc hostaccess -f -
